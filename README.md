# ionicSample
This project is a simple Ionic project that contains a documentation of the principal components of Ionic. The purpose of building this project is to learn and study about the framework.

## With the Ionic tool:

Take the name after `ionic-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myApp tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myApp` and run:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
